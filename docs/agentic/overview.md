# Architecture and Concepts

## Core Components

### Agent
The central component that orchestrates all interactions:
- **Conversation Management**: Maintains context and history
- **Tool Registry**: Manages available tools and their execution
- **LLM Integration**: Handles communication with language models
- **State Management**: Tracks agent state and configuration

### Tools
Modular components that extend agent capabilities:
```python
class FileTool(Tool):
    """Tool for file operations"""
    def execute(self, path: str, content: str) -> str:
        with open(path, 'w') as f:
            f.write(content)
        return f"Wrote {len(content)} bytes to {path}"
```

### Infrastructure
Cloud-native infrastructure components:
- **Secret Management**: Secure handling of API keys and credentials
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration system
- **Cloud Integration**: Native support for cloud services
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code support

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity
Each component is designed to be independent and replaceable:
- Swap LLM providers without changing agent code
- Add custom tools without modifying core components
- Replace infrastructure components as needed

### 2. Type Safety
Strong typing throughout the codebase:
```python
from typing import Dict, Any

class Tool:
    def execute(self, **kwargs: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Execute the tool with type-safe parameters"""
        pass
```

### 3. Cloud Native
Built for modern cloud environments:
- Container-ready architecture
- Cloud service integration
- Infrastructure as Code support

### 4. Developer Experience
Focus on making development smooth and intuitive:
- Clear API design
- Comprehensive documentation
- Type hints and IDE support
